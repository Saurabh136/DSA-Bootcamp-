--Syntax of Array:
--   datatype[ ] variable_name = new datatype[size];



1]  All the datatype in the array should be same

2]  Breakdown of an array :
          for eg.  int[ ] rollnums = new int [ ];
      here,  int[ ] rollnums; ---- declaration of array. , rollnums is getting defined in the stack
               rollnums = new[5]; ---- initialisation; actually here the object is being created in the memory(heap)

3] Array objects are in heap

4] Heap objects are not continues

5] Memory is allocated at runtime i.e Dynamic Memory Allocation

6] Array objects in Java may not be continous depends on JVM

7] New is the keyword used to create an object

8] Strings are immutable in java but Arrays are muttable , mutable simply means Array object can be change.

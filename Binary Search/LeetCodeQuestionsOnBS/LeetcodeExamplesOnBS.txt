Ex. 1) 744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target 
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-smallest-letter-greater-than-target/

approach :-  1] Exact same approach as the ceiling of the number
             2] Ignore '>=' only ' >' is required for this question
             3] If an array contains arr=['c','d','e','f','j'] & the target= j
               then here no letter is greater then 'j', so in this case it will return the first index

Ex. 2) 34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/
STEPS :    1] lOGIC : If arr = [5,7,7,7,7,8,8,9] --> target= 7 , then o/p will be index [1,4]
           2] find first occurence of the target in an given array
           3] if it is on the left side of the mid then use End = mid - 1

If its Sorted array then use Binary Search

Recursion is when one fuction calls another function
while the function is not finished executing it will remain in stack
When a function is finished executing it is removed from the stack, and the flow of program is restored to where that function was called

What is Recursion ? 
Ans: Recusrion is function that calls itself

Why Recursion?
Ans: It helps in solving bigger and complex problems in a simple way
     You can convert recursion solution into iteration & vice versa
     Space complexity is not constant because of recursive calls

How to understand and approach a problem??    V.V.IMP
Ans: 1) Identify if you can breakdown problem into smaller problem.
     2) Write the recurance relation if needed.
     3) Draw the recursive tree
     4) About the tree:-- a) See the flow of function, how they are getting stack
                  b) Identify and focus on left tree calls and rigth tree calls
              c) Draw the tree and pointer again and again using pen and paper.
              d) Use a drebugger to see the flow
     5) See how the values and what type of values(int,string,etc) are returned at each step, see where the function call will come out of.
       in the end , you will come out of the main function

Recurance relation:  F(N) = O(1)(comparision) + f(N/2)(Dividing Array in half)

# Types of recurrance relation:
1) Linear recurance relation: Fibo
2) Divide & conquer recurrence relation : Binary search
